Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## Lessons Learned

- **Astro Basics**: Understanding the fundamentals of Astro and how it works.
- **Markdown Integration**: Learning how to write and format content using Markdown.
- **Project Structure**: Familiarizing myself with the project structure and file organization.

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
