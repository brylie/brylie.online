Have you ever wondered how some of your favorite songs create such emotionally rich and unexpected chord progressions? Many composers and songwriters use a powerful technique that involves borrowing chords from different scales or modes. Today, we'll explore a specific approach called "parallel majors" that can immediately add new colors to your compositions.

## What Are Parallel Majors?

Before diving into parallel majors, let's establish some foundational concepts.

### Understanding Modes

A mode is essentially a scale that starts on a different note of a parent major scale. For example, if we take the C major scale (C, D, E, F, G, A, B) but start on D instead, we get D Dorian mode (D, E, F, G, A, B, C).

The seven modes of the major scale are:

1. Ionian (major)
2. Dorian
3. Phrygian
4. Lydian
5. Mixolydian
6. Aeolian (natural minor)
7. Locrian

When all these modes share the same starting note or tonic (like C Ionian, C Dorian, C Phrygian, etc.), we call them "parallel modes."

### The Concept of Parallel Majors

The "parallel majors" concept takes each of these modes and identifies its parent major scale. For example:

- C Ionian is simply the C major scale
- C Dorian contains the same notes as B♭ major, but starting on C
- C Aeolian (C minor) contains the same notes as E♭ major, but starting on C

This gives us access to a whole new palette of chords to work with in our compositions, while still maintaining C as our tonal center.

## The Parallel Majors Chart

Here's a chart showing each C mode, its parallel major scale, and the chords that appear in those parallel major keys:

| C Mode           | Parallel Major | I   | II  | III | IV  | V   | VI  | VII   |
| ---------------- | -------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ----- |
| **C Ionian**     | C Major        | C   | Dm  | Em  | F   | G   | Am  | Bdim  |
| **C Dorian**     | B♭ Major       | B♭  | Cm  | Dm  | E♭  | F   | Gm  | Adim  |
| **C Phrygian**   | A♭ Major       | A♭  | B♭m | Cm  | D♭  | E♭  | Fm  | Gdim  |
| **C Lydian**     | G Major        | G   | Am  | Bm  | C   | D   | Em  | F♯dim |
| **C Mixolydian** | F Major        | F   | Gm  | Am  | B♭  | C   | Dm  | Edim  |
| **C Aeolian**    | E♭ Major       | E♭  | Fm  | Gm  | A♭  | B♭  | Cm  | Ddim  |
| **C Locrian**    | D♭ Major       | D♭  | E♭m | Fm  | G♭  | A♭  | B♭m | Cdim  |

## How to Use Parallel Majors in Your Compositions

Now for the fun part—putting this knowledge to practical use! Here's a step-by-step approach:

### 1. Start with a Simple Progression in a Major Key

Let's begin with a common chord progression in C major:

```
C - Am - F - G
```

This is a I - vi - IV - V progression, one of the most used progressions in pop music.

### 2. Identify Opportunities for Chord Borrowing

Each chord in your progression is a potential candidate for "borrowing" from a parallel major. Look for places where an emotional shift would enhance your music.

### 3. Select Alternative Chords from Parallel Majors

Let's try replacing some chords in our progression by borrowing from parallel majors:

**Example 1:** Replace the vi chord (Am) with the parallel major version from C Aeolian

- Original: C - Am - F - G
- Parallel major of C Aeolian is E♭ major
- The vi chord in E♭ major is Cm
- New progression: C - Cm - F - G

This small change adds a beautiful, melancholic twist to an otherwise standard progression.

**Example 2:** Replace the IV chord (F) with the parallel major version from C Phrygian

- Original: C - Am - F - G
- Parallel major of C Phrygian is A♭ major
- The IV chord in A♭ major is D♭
- New progression: C - Am - D♭ - G

This creates a more dramatic, unexpected shift that can work wonderfully for song bridges or pre-choruses.

### 4. Experiment with Different Combinations

Don't stop at just one borrowed chord! Try various combinations:

**Example 3:** Borrow multiple chords

- Original: C - Am - F - G
- Replace Am with Cm (from C Aeolian's parallel major)
- Replace G with C (from C Mixolydian's parallel major)
- New progression: C - Cm - F - C

## Practical Applications

### In Popular Music

This technique of borrowing from parallel majors (often called "modal interchange" or "modal mixture") is used extensively in popular music:

- The Beatles used this technique in songs like "Penny Lane" and "In My Life"
- Radiohead's complex harmonies often involve modal interchange
- Jazz standards frequently borrow chords from parallel modes

### Tips for Songwriters

1. **Start simple:** Begin by borrowing just one chord in your progression
2. **Trust your ears:** If it sounds good, it is good
3. **Create contrast:** Borrowed chords work best when they create emotional contrast with surrounding chords
4. **Consider melody:** Make sure your melody notes work with your borrowed chords
5. **Think functionally:** Borrowed chords can serve similar harmonic functions to the chords they replace

## Common Borrowed Chord Combinations

Some borrowed chord combinations work particularly well:

- **The Minor IV:** Borrowing the iv chord from the parallel minor (using Fm in a C major progression)
- **The Flat VII:** Using the ♭VII chord from Mixolydian (B♭ in the key of C)
- **The Flat VI:** Using the ♭VI chord from Aeolian (A♭ in the key of C)

## Conclusion

Understanding and using parallel majors doesn't require advanced music theory knowledge—just a willingness to experiment. By borrowing chords from these parallel major scales, you can add emotional depth and harmonic interest to even the simplest progressions.

Next time you're writing a song and feel like a chord progression needs something special, try borrowing a chord from one of these parallel major scales. Your ears (and your listeners) will thank you!

## Practice Exercise

Take a simple chord progression in a key you're comfortable with and try replacing one chord with a borrowed chord from a parallel major. Notice how it changes the emotional quality of your progression. There's no wrong answer here—if it sounds good to you, you're doing it right!
